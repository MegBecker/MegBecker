  I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as Iâ€™ve always known him, Jeff. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Bow ties are cool. Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Brave heart, Clara.
